Description:

    - To accomplish this task, the program makes three calls into the operating system a call to :->
        1. open(), opens the file and creates it;
        2. write(), writes some data to the file;
        3. close(), simply closes the file thus indicating the program wonâ€™t be writing any more data to it.

    - These system calls are routed to the part of the operating system called the file system, which then handles
      the requests and returns some kind of error code to the user.

    - You might be wondering what the OS does in order to actually write to disk.
        - The file system has to do a fair bit of work:
            - first figuring out where on disk this new data will reside,
            - then keeping track of it in various structures the file system maintains.
        - Doing so requires issuing I/O requests to the underlying storage device, to either read existing structures or update (write) them.
          As anyone who has written a device driver knows, getting a device to do something on your behalf is an intricate and detailed process.
          It requires a deep knowledge of the low-level device interface and its exact semantics. Fortunately, the OS provides a standard and
          simple way to access devices through its system calls.

    - Thus, the OS is sometimes seen as a standard library.
